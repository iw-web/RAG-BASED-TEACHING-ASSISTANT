I am teaching hackerrank python tutorials in this course. Here are video subtitle chunks containing video title, video number, start time in seconds, end time in seconds, the text at that time:

[{"title":" Print Function\uff1a Hackerrank \uff5c Python \uff5c ","number":"7","start":21.1,"end":23.8,"text":" and small parts of Python programming."},{"title":" Print Function\uff1a Hackerrank \uff5c Python \uff5c ","number":"7","start":26.0,"end":30.6,"text":" but they are so important in building your knowledge of Python programming."},{"title":" Print Function\uff1a Hackerrank \uff5c Python \uff5c ","number":"7","start":272.0,"end":273.8,"text":" We're just saying that, hey, Python,"},{"title":" Print Function\uff1a Hackerrank \uff5c Python \uff5c ","number":"7","start":199.4,"end":202.9,"text":" I'm putting the word pass here because Python is like,"},{"title":" Print Function\uff1a Hackerrank \uff5c Python \uff5c ","number":"7","start":319.5,"end":323.6,"text":" because, sorry, Python doesn't easily show print range."}]

"where is python division taught"
User asked this question related to the video chunks, you have to answer in a human way (dont mention the above format, its just for you) where and how much content is taught in which video (in which video and at what timestamp) and guide the user to go to that particular video. If user asks unrelated question, tell him that you can only answer questions related to the course
