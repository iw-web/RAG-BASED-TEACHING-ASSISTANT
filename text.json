    "text": " Hi there, welcome back. In this video, I'm going to show you how to tackle this problem from the print function in the hacker rank assessment questions. What I have, like always, on the left, I have the actual hacker rank dashboard of mine. And on the right, I have a Jupyter notebook that helps me to teach you some important and small parts of Python programming. They might sound really small, but they are so important in building your knowledge of Python programming. So, looking at the hacker rank dashboard, on the left side, I've got the task. In the white side, in the white area, I've got the area to write my code. If you haven't seen my videos before, no problems. I can tell you that this part of the code is the execution part. So, this is when we actually get the work to be applied onto what we have written. But here is the actual function. So, think about it. Imagine you've bought a hammer. So, this part of the top part is actually having the hammer, like owning a hammer. But does that mean that you're actually using that hammer to put an artwork on the wall? No, that happens here. This is when you pick up the hammer and do that bit of work. So, I just wanted to let you know that. Don't be scared about what you see here. If you don't understand what it does, I've left a link to the video that I'm explaining to you what it does. But for now, let's stick to the task. So, like always, please read the task really carefully. The included code stop will read an integer n. So, this is where I'm reading the integer n. Look at that. So, if I copy that in my Jupyter notebook, I'm getting an integer. So, this is the integer I'm getting from the person who is sitting behind the computer. And I'm putting it in the variable n. Look at that. I'm saying, okay, enter the integer, maybe 56. So, n, if I print it again, you will see that n is 56. So, this is one part of the execution part. So, you get an n and then you essentially want to do something on n, which will come from the top part. But for now, I've put it in a comment. I will come back and complete that later. So, we're getting an n. Thank you. Without using any string methods, try to print the following. So, print from 1 all the way to n. So, for example, if your integer is 5, we want you to print 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 right next to each other. For example, oh, the example is here. n equals 5 and the program expects us to print 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So, if the user gives 1000 here, they want you to print from 1 to 1000 next to each other. I think that would be a crazy thing to do. But, well, if they ask for it. So, let's make a new function and call it, for example, print consecutive numbers. How about that? And give me a number and I will print the consecutive numbers for that. I'm putting the word pass here because Python is like, okay, he said pass means that he doesn't want to do anything right now, but he will start writing things later. Why I did that is that I want you to remember that, for example, the type of 56 is an integer, but the type of 56, which is exactly the same thing, but it's not, is a string. This question wants us to return a string. If you look at that, it says, print the list of integers from 1 through n as a string. If the user says n equals 5, they don't want us to print 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. However, they want us to print 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 as a string. So, that might be a bit confusing, but right now I'll tell you what it means. Let's get rid of that. Just have an empty cell. Beautiful. Let's start writing our function. What we want to start, we want to start with an empty container, like a bowl that doesn't have anything in it. Let's call it final string and let's put nothing in it. We're just saying that, hey, Python, final string is an empty string, because we know that these people want us to return a string. We're just going to make an empty bowl for the string. Okay? Now, for i in range of 1 and number plus 1. Let's use the word pass again, because I'm going to come back. I'm just putting pass here so that the code doesn't break in case I run it. You might ask, what is this? Well, it's a for loop. If the user gives me 5 as n, the range of 1 to 5, I can't really print it unless I convert it into a list. Okay, let's convert it to a list and then print it, because, sorry, Python doesn't easily show print range. You can see that. Let me just show you. It will not print anything. It will just say, oh, it's a range. No, I want you to print the list of that range. But the funny thing is that range from 1 to 5 does not include 5. Keep that in your mind. This is always true. Range is not inclusive of the end. So if you want to see 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, you need to say, okay, go from 1 to 6, because 5 plus 1 is 6. So range is not inclusive of the end of the range. That's why I have num plus 1. But why did I make this for loop? That's pretty easy, because I want to say, for i in range 1 and n plus 1, oops, colon, print i. Look, it will give them one by one to me. And I have an empty bowl. I made it here. I said, final string is an empty bowl. I will take them one by one, put them in the empty bowl. Very easy. How do I do that? Well, my empty bowl is not going to be empty for a long time, because every time I will add i to it, but in its string format. Remember that final string is a string. So you can't add a string to a number. i is a number from what you can see here. I need to convert it to a string to be able to add it to another string. So every time when i is 1, final string is still empty. So empty plus 1 is a bowl with 1 in it. Go up. This is 2 now. So a bowl with number 1 in it plus 2 is a bowl with number 1 and number 2 in it. Go up. 3. A bowl with number 1 and number 2 in it plus number 3, and so forth. And the story continues. So once you have added everything, all you need to do is, let's make sure I type this correct, you print the final string. Let's run this code. Hopefully it works. Fingers crossed. And you will see that it's not going to run. Why? The reason is, I told you in the beginning, I said, this is the hammer that you have bought. Beautiful. You have a hammer. But you can't just hang a frame by a sitting hammer. You need to use that hammer. And that's here. So after I have this hammer prepared, I need to say, okay, print consecutive numbers. Let's make sure I'm getting it right on n. I'll just copy. Yeah, that's the right one. If I run this now, it means that I had a hammer and I used that hammer. Congratulations. That worked. So submit it. Let's let them test more cases. All cases are great. And ta-da. If you like this video, hit the like button, subscribe to my channel.
